 abstract = {This paper proposes a very tractable approach to modeling changes in regime. The parameters of an autoregression are viewed as the outcome of a discrete-state Markov process. For example, the mean growth rate of a nonstationary series may be subject to occasional, discrete shifts. The econometrician is presumed not to observe these shifts directly, but instead must draw probabilistic inference about whether and when they may have occurred based on the observed behavior of the series. The paper presents an algorithm for drawing such estimation of population parameters by the method of maximum likelihood and provides the foundation for forecasting future values of the series. An empirical application of this technique to postwar U.S. real GNP suggests that the periodic shift from a positive growth rate to a negative growth rate is a recurrent feature of the U.S. business cycle, and indeed could be used as an objective criterion for defining and measuring economic recessions. The estimated parameter values suggest that a typical economic recession is associated with a 3% permanent drop in the level of GNP.},

abstract = {There is considerable interest today in the forecasting of conflict dynamics. Commonly, the root mean square error and other point metrics are used to evaluate the forecasts from such models. However, conflict processes are non-linear, so these point metrics often do not produce adequate evaluations of the calibration and sharpness of the forecast models. Forecast density evaluation improves the model evaluation. We review tools for density evaluation, including continuous rank probability scores, verification rank histograms, and sharpness plots. The usefulness of these tools for evaluating conflict forecasting models is explained. We illustrate this, first, in a comparison of several time series models’ forecasts of simulated data from a Markov-switching process, and second, in a comparison of several models’ abilities to forecast conflict dynamics in the Cross Straits. These applications show the pitfalls of relying on point metrics alone for evaluating the quality of conflict forecasting models. As in other fields, it is more useful to employ a suite of tools. A non-linear vector autoregressive model emerges as the model which is best able to forecast conflict dynamics between China and Taiwan.}

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a Markovian approach to study the stability and growth of citations in academic journals by featuring a regime-switching analysis. We characterize the regime structure exhibited by the series of citations available in the Web of Science database and determine the series’ transition probabilities across regimes. Our main result shows that for most of the journals studied, the series of citations exhibit a stable growth, remaining majorly in a dominant regime identified as one of low or high number of citations.}

 abstract = {This article examines differences in expansionary and contractionary phases of the business cycle. By extending the nonlinear Markov-switching estimation method of Hamilton to incorporate time-varying probabilities of transitions between the phases, the marginal benefits of the time-varying transition probability Markov-switching model are highlighted. Using this technique, I document the high correlation between the evolution of the phases inferred from the model and traditional reference cycles for monthly output data. Many of the economic variables that determine the time-varying probabilities help to predict turning points. The predictive power of standard leading indicators is evaluated and compared.},
